The commands.Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an
object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undoable operations.

In this example, your personal maid is none other than
"Chitti the Robo". Hence, there might be any kind of chore that
you can request him to do. So, we make use of the Command Pattern
to decouple all the commands from the task, irrespective of the type of task
that needs to be executed by Chitti.
